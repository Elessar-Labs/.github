Welcome to **Elessar Labs** a small, focused team building at the intersection of decentralized finance, advanced AI tooling, and mission critical systems.

### Our Current Focus Areas

- **Glacier**  
  A new participant in UniswapX, operating as a sophisticated filler in the protocol's permissionless auction based settlement system. We compete to execute user signed orders using optimized strategies, sourcing liquidity from diverse on chain pools and external sources while providing MEV protection, gas efficiency, and the best possible swap outcomes for traders.

- **MELT**  
  A soon to be active contributor to one of the leading decentralized trading protocols, focused on intelligent order execution and settlement optimization. We will soon operate in highly competitive batch environments to deliver superior outcomes for users across aggregated liquidity via the CoW protocol.

- **FRACTAL**  
  A tool inspired by cutting edge research in recursive reasoning architectures. It extends frontier models with structured, self delegating capabilities, enabling efficient handling of complex, long horizon tasks through programmatic decomposition and sub task orchestration to cheaper models.

### Philosophy

We build quietly, ship reliably, and prioritize our customers and partners.
Our work spans permissionless protocols, agentic AI frameworks, and high stakes infrastructure always with an eye toward long term resilience and real world impact.
